        With a diverse background spanning sound design, artistic direction, digital strategy, and creative facilitation, 
        I bring a unique multidisciplinary perspective to full-stack development. From conceptualising immersive 
        audio-visual performances to spearheading comprehensive web presence overhauls for energy and hospitality 
        clients, my experience demonstrates adaptability and technical innovation across creative and digital domains. 
        That&apos;s why I&apos;ve chosen to undertake a bootcamp with Northcoders - to synthesise my creative expertise with 
        robust technical skills and continue pushing boundaries in digital innovation. I am an adaptable, intuitive and 
        passionate person whose natural curiosity, innovation, and analytical skill set means that I thrive in dynamic 
        roles that demand learning and growth.</p>

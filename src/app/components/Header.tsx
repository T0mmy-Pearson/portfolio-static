        The variety and breadth of my work so far has led me to become ever more interested in developing the
        technical skills required to work across industries. That&apos;s why I&apos;ve chosen to undertake a bootcamp with
        Northcoders, to develop and grow my technical skills, to grow my work as a writer, artist and designer. These
        experiences have enabled me to learn and cultivate a diverse range of skills, honed in roles within the arts,
publishing and marketing. I bring a dynamism and energy to any role that tasks me to collaborate with
others, think critically, prioritise and manage changing, tight deadlines. I am an adaptable, intuitive and
passionate person with a diverse range of interests and my natural curiosity, innovativity, and analytical skill
set means that I thrive in dynamic roles that demand learning and growth.</p>
